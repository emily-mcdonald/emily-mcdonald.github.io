                As the population of older adults increases throughout the world, there is also a greater demand for specialized interventions for older adults who receive assistance from care providers. A potential technology intervention to support this population is robot care providers. Although previous research has explored older adults’ perceptions of robot care providers, the studies primarily included independently functioning older adults. This study sought to explore the perceptions of robot care providers from older adults who are currently receiving assistance from a human care prover to gain insight into their understanding of successful care, and how robot care providers can be designed to effectively care for older adults. The results suggest that in the care provider context, older adults desire a robot that goes beyond simply performing the tasks, but is also caring, kind, and sociable.  When designing robots for older adult care, robots should also be social to support successful interactions.  </br></br>

        <div id="goalInfo">The goal of this project was to interview older adults who receive assistance in their every day lives to gain insights on what they might like an accept in a robot care provider. </div>   

        <div id="methodsTitle">Methods</div>
        <div id="methodsInfo">We conducted twenty-four interviews with older adults who receive care at least four days per week - twelve from independent living facilities and twelve from assisted living facilities. Using the transcripts from these interviews, we designed a coding scheme with both bottom-up and top-down themes to identify most frequently identified factors that older adults care about for robot care provider design.  </div>

        <div id="resultsTitle">Results</div>
        <div id="resultsInfo">The older adults mostly imagined the robot being machine-like and made of metal, but they still considered that the robot was male. In addition, many of them also imagined it had facial features and arms. This suggests that despite imagining a mechanical robot, they also attribute some ‘human’ like traits such as gender. Older adults also reported wanting a robot that was agreeable, conscientious, and emotionally stable.  </div>
