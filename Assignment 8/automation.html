                Automated driving features were developed to improve driver safety and minimize driversâ€™ cognitive workload, but this is only if drivers rely on these systems appropriately.  Currently, there is a discrepancy between actual system efficacy and driver acceptance; drivers report preferences for manual control despite research confirming the safety of the automation. This research aims to identify main factors that lead to this lack of user acceptance in automation in vehicles with the intent of later designing a prototype to improve acceptance. This study will expand our understanding of automation acceptance within the driver context and begin to remedy this through improved design.
