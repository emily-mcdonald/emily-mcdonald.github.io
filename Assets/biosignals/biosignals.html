                Technological innovations can make us feel both connected and isolated from other people, and technology-enabled communication has become a core part of daily life, yet sharing meaningful communication and establishing authentic connections over platforms remain a challenge. To solve this problem, we explored how we might build empathy and emotional understanding between two people through shared biosignals? We designed a two player game in which players are immersed in a dark, unfamiliar virtual reality environment that induces vulnerability. Playersâ€™ biosignals affect elements of the game, and therefore they must match their biosignals in order to successfully complete a puzzle.

        <div id="goalTitle">Goals</div>
        <div id="goalInfo"> The goals of this project were to investigate how we might build empathy and emotional understanding through shared biosignals, how we might use this to help individuals feel more comfortable experiencing vulnerability, and how we might make individuals more comfortable accepting and providing help to others in a state of vulnerability.  
 </div>   

        <div id="methodsTitle">Methods</div>
        <div id="methodsInfo">We conducted multiple rounds of low-fi prototyping sessions to see what conditions can easily make people feel vulnerable but not scared, how people felt working together in these conditions, and how that differed from working styles under different conditions. We then moved to hi-fi prototyping with a Unity game and Oculus Rift VR set that tasked players with puzzle matching with glowing blocks in a dark room.   </div>

        <div id="resultsTitle">Results</div>
        <div id="resultsInfo">Taking away one sense (sight) immediately puts people on edge, and it's very easy to induce a state of vulnerability, but we found that both being in this situation with another person and having a task to complete distracted players from these feelings, and many reported that they almost immediately forgot that they were blind. We hope that players can carry these results into their day to day lives, and learn to reach out for help and reassurement in scenarios where they may feel vulnerable.   </div>
