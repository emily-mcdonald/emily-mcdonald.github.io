                Automated driving features were developed to improve driver safety and minimize drivers' cognitive workload, but this is only if drivers rely on these systems appropriately.  Currently, there is a discrepancy between actual system efficacy and driver acceptance; drivers report preferences for manual control despite research confirming the safety of the automation. This research aims to identify main factors that lead to this lack of user acceptance in automation in vehicles with the intent of later designing a prototype to improve acceptance. This study will expand our understanding of automation acceptance within the driver context and begin to remedy this through improved design.</br></br>

        <div id="goalTitle">Goals</div>
        <div id="goalInfo">The goals of this project were to interview users to identify reasons leading to users' distrust of automated features in vehicles and then to use these results to inform design ideas for automated features.</div>   

        <div id="methodsTitle">Methods</div>
        <div id="methodsInfo">I conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with fifteen participants over two months; these participants consisted of college-age students, and most of these participants had never used any automated features before. To evaluate my data, I designed a coding scheme to produce frequency data from the transcripts. </div>

        <div id="resultsTitle">Results</div>
        <div id="resultsInfo">A main concern to address in the acceptance of automation in vehicles is addressing and improving users’ mental models of automated driving. With better understanding of the available technology, users will be able to learn and gain more experience with automation. These improvements should focus on the system providing accurate, real-time feedback and information back to the driver about the progress and actions of the system.  Another recommendation for improving users’ acceptance is implementing clear structures and understanding of the control dynamic while driving. I would also recommend elements to ensure adequate situational awareness while driving to reduce driver complacency, which is a known problem in any automated system.</div>
